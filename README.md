ASP.NET SignalR Canvas App with Chat
This project is a simple multi-user canvas drawing and chat application built with ASP.NET Core SignalR and Blazor. It was created primarily to learn SignalR, with Blazor also used as a learning exercise. The styling was generated by AI, so it is basic and not the focus of this repository.
